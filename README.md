# TipEase Marketing Site

***Pitch:*** Service workers need a way to collect tips directly, rather than through their employers. This app will allow payment processing directly to service workers as a tip.

***MVP:*** Service Employee can login and create, read and update a profile. Regular User can login and select a service employee and give them a tip.

***Stretch:*** Implement a payment feature that actually allows money exchange with a service like, paypal or stripe or venmo.
